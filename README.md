# Risk_Analysis_of_Prosper_Loan
Prosper is Americaâ€™s first marketplace peer-to-peer lending platform, with over $12 billion in funded loans. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan  status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit score, etc.
In this project, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Prosper loan data set from 2005-2014  was conducted, in order to dig out some inspiring and valuable insights about the features that can affect the loan status.
